# Automate updates of prettier, standard and other JavaScript linting tools using GitHub Actions

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/gr2m/prettier-auto-update-demo.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Automating npm dependencies using a service such as [Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io/) is great! I would not be able maintain as many projects without that kind of automation.

However, linters such as [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) or [Standard](https://standardjs.com/) are different. Every fix or new feature version introduces new formatting rules and might break your tests. 

I wrote a blog post on how to automate the updates of Prettier by creating pull requests which include the updated code, check it out: https://dev.to/gr2m/automate-updates-of-prettier-and-other-linting-tools-5bl0-temp-slug-1958571/edit
